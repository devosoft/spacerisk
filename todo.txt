color can be based off of ID, but is not inherent to agent
  * color only matters to web interface

game::AddAgent(Agent *) should set the agent ID, so all agents in the game have unique IDs (and
thus unique colors)

fix tests to include TestGame : public game
also make agents<> in game be protected, not private

new question: who owns agents? (programming hygine)
  * pointers need to get deleted when game is done
  * those pointers owned by interfaces shouldn't get deleted when game destructs
    - note that game is owned by the interface currently, and that needs to get fixed

  * what manages everything?
